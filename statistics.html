        <h2> Women</h2>
<p>
     Globally, an estimated 736 million women—almost one in three—have been subjected to physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence, non-partner sexual violence, or both at least once in their life (30 percent of women aged 15 and older). 

<br>Most violence against women is perpetrated by current or former husbands or intimate partners.</br>

<br>Of those who have been in a relationship, almost one in four adolescent girls aged 15–19 (24 percent) have experienced physical and/or sexual violence from an intimate partner or husband. </br>

<br>In 2018, an estimated one in seven women had experienced physical and/or sexual violence from an intimate partner or husband in the past 12 months (13 percent of women aged 15–49). </br>

<br>Globally, violence against women disproportionately affects low- and lower-middle-income countries and regions.  </br>

<br>Globally, 81,000 women and girls were killed in 2020; around 47,000 of them (58 percent) died at the hands of an intimate partner or a family member, which equals to a woman or girl being killed every 11 minutes in their home. In 58 percent of all killings perpetrated by intimate partners or other family members, the victim was a woman or girl.

         <h2> Men</h2>

        <p> 
       <br>  The Office for National Statistics figures show every year that one in the three victims of domestic abuse are male equating to 757,000 men (1.561m women).</br> 

<br>One in 6-7 men and one in 4 women will be a victim of domestic abuse in their lifetime. </br>

<br>Of domestic abuse crimes recorded by the police, 26% were committed against men. This equates to c155,000 offences per year. </br>

<br>Only 4.4% of victims of domestic abuse being supporting by local domestic services are men according to SafeLives data. This highlights how few men are being supported for local domestic abuse services. </br>

<br>Over the pandemic period, the charity saw an increase of calls to its helpline by one quarter and visits to its website by 75%. </br>

<br>61% of the men who call the ManKind Initiative helpline have never spoken to anyone before about the abuse they are suffering and 64% would not have called if the helpline was not anonymous. </br> 

<br>There are 39 organisations with 238 spaces in refuges or safe houses for men – with only 58 of those places are dedicated for men. </br>

<br>Half of male victims (49%) fail to tell anyone they are a victim of domestic abuse and are two and a half times less likely to tell anyone than female victims (19%). </br>

<br> 11% of male victims (7.2% women) have considered taking their life due to partner abuse. The charity has seen an increase in calls regarding suicide ideation over the pandemic period. </br>

<br>Over the past five years (April 2015 to March 20), on average 12 men per year had been killed by a partner or ex-partner (74 women per year). </br></p>
